## Getting Started:

* [Memory Card Game](https://priya131998.github.io/memory-card-game/)
* There are few bugs that I need to fix such as only starting the game when the button is pressed

## Next Steps:

1. Fixing the bugs
* Only starting the game when the button is pressed
* Sometimes my cards get stuck when its flipping I need to figure that out
* When I click the start button multiple times the timer acts a little weird so I need also fix that
* I need to add a rest button so that I dont have to keep refreshing the pages.
